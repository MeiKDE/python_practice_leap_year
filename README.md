# Leap Year Checker

This Python script defines a function called `is_leap_year()` that determines whether a given year is a leap year or not. The function follows the rules of the Gregorian calendar to decide if the year is a leap year.


## Overview

Leap years are used to keep our calendar in alignment with Earth's revolutions around the Sun. This function checks whether the input `year` satisfies the conditions to be a leap year. 

## Usage
You can use this function by calling `is_leap_year()` and passing an integer as an argument, representing the year you want to check.


# Check if the year 2024 is a leap year
is_leap_year(2024)  # Output: "Leap Year"
